ACS and ACS ExtProd RPM in branch master
ACE+TAO 6.3.0-<ACSVERSION> RPM in ace-tao branch. It has ACS patches applied to the source

Some issues in ACS ExtProd with Rpaths due to Eclipse libs and TcTlk build. Both leave libs on "non-system" folders.

A temp fix done for the moment was to comment out the section %__arch_install_post (last 4 lines) 
in the .rpmmacro file in /home/<user used to build-rebuild rpm>

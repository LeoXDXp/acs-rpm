ACS and ACS ExtProd RPM in branch master
ACE+TAO 6.3.0-ACS_VERSION RPM in ace-tao branch. It has ACS patches applied to the source.
JacORB branch not built yet. Mico Spec available for testing
All has been thought for CentOS 7 and above.

# Repository
A repo (and the .repo file for /etc/yum.repos.d/) can be found in http://repo.csrg.cl.
It contains the exact version packages required in ACS and ExtProd in the form of rpms, which have been colected
from Fedora 21 to 24, OpenSuse and JPP6 (JPackage Project), among other rpm sources.

#Issues
- Some issues in ACS ExtProd with Rpaths due to Eclipse libs. Both leave libs on "non-system" folders.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RPath_Packaging_Draft 
A temp fix done for the moment was to comment out the section %__arch_install_post (last 4 lines) 
in the .rpmmacro file in /home/<user used to build-rebuild rpm>

- Building JacORB, Tctlk and Mico inside the RPM has the problem: 
Found '/home/rpm/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/ACS-ExtProds-OCT2016-1.el7.centos.x86_64' in installed files; aborting
So, for the moment, this are compiled outside the RPM, through the scripts in LGPL/ExtProd/Install/ and used as sources directly.
Sources and buildlogs available in http://repo.csrg.cl/Sources/

#Pending:
- Sign the RPMs: http://giovannitorres.me/how-to-setup-an-rpm-signing-key.html
- Complete the SysV daemons of acs commands (used in a Pacemaker PoC) and migrate them to SystemD
